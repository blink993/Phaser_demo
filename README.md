Smart City (Serious Game)

Serious Game appeared long time before the diffusion of computer technology in everyday life. During the early 1970s Clark Abt used this expression in his book entitled exactly “serious games” where he also gave a first definition of what is a serious game really means: “reduced to its formal essence, a game is an activity among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting context. A more conventional definition would say that a game is a context with rules among adversaries trying to win objectives. We are concerned with serious games in the sense that these games have an explicit and carefully thought out educational purpose and are not intended to be played primarily for amusement.”
